Hello! I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at The University of Texas at Austin and I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Shuchi Chawla. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate in Yao Class, Tsinghua University. During the Spring and Summer of 2022, I made a research visit at The University of Michigan, where I held a wonderful experience to work with Prof. Thatchaphol Saranurak.

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of computer science and economics. I hold a broad interest towards many aspects in the area, including mechanism design, online algorithms and voting theory.

Beyond research, I am also interested in various sports, especially soccer and basketball.
